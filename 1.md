This is a quick-start, a blur of color. You're not going to get very many
details here, but you *will* get to jump into the LFE REPL and see a little
code in action.

For those that would enjoy a more gradual introduction (with a bit more Erlang)
thus having the time to see the stars (and not just stunning plaid), you may be
interested in checking out the
<a href="http://docs.lfe.io/user-guide/intro/1.html">User Guide</a>.


### 1.1 lfetool

Many in the LFE community use ``lfetool``, a utility specifically designed for
creating LFE projects of various types, complete with stubbed code and unit
tests. For the purposes of a quick start, all of your LFE workflow needs can be
met by  ``lfetool``. This guide will use it almost exclusively -- all in the
interst of sending you a week and a half into the future.

You can install ``lfetool`` with the following, which will install it into
``/usr/local/bin``:

```bash
$ curl -L -o ./lfetool \
    https://raw.github.com/lfe/lfetool/stable/lfetool
$ bash ./lfetool install
```

If you would like to instal it in a different directory, you may use the
following verbose command form:

```bash
$ bash ./lfetool install lfetool /opt/scripts/bin
```

Note that ``lfetool`` supports Erlang R15, R16, and 17.

If you need ``sudo`` to put the script there, be sure to set the ownership:

```bash
$ chown $USER /usr/local/bin/lfetool
```

That way you'll be able to use the ``update`` command to get the latest version
of ``lfetool`` in the future.


### 1.2 Other Dependencies


#### Erlang

First and foremost, you will need Erlang installed.

 * On Mac OS X, this is as easy as executing ```brew install erlang```
 * On Ubuntu ```apt-get install erlang```.

You can also install Erlang from the various pre-built packages
provided on the <a href="http://www.erlang.org/download.html">official Erlang
download page</a> or from the
<a href="https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/download-erlang-otp">Erlang
Solutions page</a> (which supports many more package types).


#### rebar

``rebar`` is a tool for managing project dependencies, compiling them, and
compiling your project's source code. Most recent Erlang projects have a
``rebar.config`` file in them, indicating their support of ``rebar``.

``lfetool`` uses ```rebar``` to build LFE as well as managing dependencies for
your projects, so go ahead and get that set up:
<a href="https://github.com/basho/rebar">download rebar</a> and follow the
instructions in the project ``README`` on Github.


#### git

You will also need to <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">download git</a>
or install it using your favourite OS package manager.

#### Optional

If you would like to easily have multiple versions of Erlang installed (or be
available for installation) on your system,
[kerl](https://github.com/spawngrid/kerl) might be the tool for you. If
you have used such tools as ``virtualenv`` in Python or Ruby's RVM, then you
should be quite comfortable with the concepts behind kerl.

Most people don't need to work with multiple versions of Erlang, however;
please consider carefully before unnecessarily complicating your development
environment.
