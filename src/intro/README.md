# Introduction

What is good style?<a href="#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

Good style in any language consists of code that is:

* Understandable
* Reusable
* Extensible
* Efficient
* Easy to develop and debug

It also helps ensure correctness, robustness, and compatibility. Maxims of good style are:

* Be explicit
* Be specific
* Be concise
* Be consisten
* Be helpful (anticipate the reader's needs)
* Be conventional (don't be obscure)
* Build abstractions at a usable level
* Allow tools to interact (referential transparency)

Know the context when reading code:

* Who wrote it and when?
* What were the business needs?
* What other factors contributed to the design decisions?
