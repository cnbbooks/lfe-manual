# Files

So far, everything we've looked at in the REPL involves typing (or pasting) code. When wanting to use the REPL to experiment with more complicated code, there's a better, time-honoured way: files. There are several ways you can use file-based code in the REPL:

* evaluation
* compilation
* including
* loading

Each of these is covered in more detail below.

## Evaluation: `slurp` and `unslurp`

TBD

### Compiling Files

[show how to compile an LFE file in the REPL]

[show how to compile an Erlang file in the LFE REPL]

## Using `include-lib` and `include-file`

TBD

## Module Loading

[show how to use `l` and `code:ensure_loaded`]
