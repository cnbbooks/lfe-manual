# Introduction

Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of computer science known as "distributed systems programming" lies a small red _e_. Orbitting this at a distance roughly proportional to the inverse of the likelihood of it being noticed is an utterly insignificant little green mug filled with the morning beverage stimulant equivalent of That Old Janx Spirit. Upon that liquid floats a little yellow _ùõå_ whose adherents are so amazingly primitive that they still think `cons`s, `car`, and `cdr` are pretty neat ideas.

This is their book.

Their language, Lisp Flavoured Erlang (henceforth "LFE"), lets you use the archaic and much-beloved S-expressions to write some of the most advanced software on the planet. LFE is a general-purpose, concurrent, functional Lisp whose underlying virtual machine (Erlang) was designed to create distributed, fault-tolerant, soft-realtime, highly-availale, always-up, hot-swappable appliances, applications, and services. In addition to fashionable digital watches, LFE sports immutable data, pattern-matching, eager evaluation, and dynamic typing.

This manual will not only teach you what all of that means and why you want it in your breakfast cereal, but also: how to create LFE programs; what exactly are the basic elements of the language; the ins-and-outs of extremely efficient and beautiful clients and servers; and much, much more.

Note, however, that the first chapter is a little different than most other books, and is in fact different from the rest of the chapters in this manual. We wrote this chapter with two guiding thoughts: firstly and foremost, we wanted to provide some practical examples of code-in-action as a context in which a programmer new to LFE could continuously refer -- from the very beginning through to the successful end --  while learning the general principles of that language; secondly, most programming language manuals are dry references to individual pieces of a language or system, not representatives of the whole, and we wanted to provide a starting place for those who learn well via examples, who _would_ benefit from a view toward that whole. For those who have already seen plenty of LFE examples and would rather get to down to the nitty-gritty, rest assured we desire your experience to be guilt-free and thus encourage you to jump into next chapter immediately!

This book is divided into 6 parts with the following foci:

* Introductory material
* Core data types and capabilities
* The basics of LFE code and projects
* Advanced language features
* The machine that is OTP
* Concluding thoughts and summaries

There is a lot of material in this book, so just take it section by section. If at any time you feel overwhelmed, simply set down the book, take a deep breath, fix yourself a cuppa, and don't panic.

Welcome to the LFE MACHINE MANUAL, the definitive LFE reference.
