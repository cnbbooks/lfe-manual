# Playing the Game

If you are still in the REPL, quit out of it so that `rebar3` can rebuild out changed module. Then start it up again:

```shell
$ rebar3 lfe repl
```

Once at the LFE propmpt, start up the application:

```lisp
lfe> (application:ensure_all_started 'guessing-game)
```

With the application and all of its dependencies started, we're ready to start the game and play it through:

```lisp
lfe> (guessing-game:start-game)
```

```
ok
Guess the number I have chosen, between 1 and 10.
```

```lisp
lfe> (guessing-game:guess 10)
```

```
ok
Your guess is too high.
```

```lisp
lfe> (guessing-game:guess 1)
```

```
ok
Your guess is too low.
```

```lisp
lfe> (guessing-game:guess 5)
```

```
ok
Your guess is too low.
```

```lisp
lfe> (guessing-game:guess 7)
```
```
ok
Your guess is too low.
```
```lisp
lfe> (guessing-game:guess 8)
```
```
ok
Well-guessed!!
Game over
```
