# From the REPL

As previously demonstrated, it is possible to start up the LFE read-eval-print-loop (REPL) using `rebar3`:

```shell
$ rebar3 lfe repl
```

Once you are at the LFE prompt, you may write a simple LFE "program" like the following:

```lisp
lfe> (io:format "~p~n" (list "Hello, World!"))
```

Or, for the terminally lazy:

```lisp
lfe> (io:format "~p~n" '("Hello, World!"))
```

While technically a program, it is not very interesting; we didn't create a function of our own, nor did we run it from outside the LFE interactive programming environment. Let's address one of those points right now.

Try this, instead:

```lisp
lfe> (defun hello-world ()
       (io:format "~p~n" '("Hello, World!")))
```

This is a simple function definition in LFE.

We can run it by calling it:

```lisp
lfe> (hello-world)
```

```text
"Hello, World!"
ok
```

When we execute our `hello-world` function, it prints our message to `standar-output` and then let's us know everything really quite fine. LFE displays `ok` as output for functions that do not return a value.

Now let's address the other point: running a Hello-World programming from outside LFE.

Hit `<CTRL-G><CTRL-C>` to exit the REPL and get back to your terminal.
