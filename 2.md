# Creating a New Project


## 2 Your First LFE Project

     style="float: left; padding-right: 1em;">A project? Already?! It sounds daunting, but it's easier than you might think. Open up a terminal window and do this in a directory of your choosing:

```bash
$ lfetool new library my-test-lib
```

It might take a minute or two to download and compile everything. Here's what ``lfetool`` is doing:

* Creating a skeleton project (of the "library" type)
* Downloading all the dependencies listed in the new
  ``rebar.config`` file that was just created for your project
* Compiling all the downloaded dependendencies
* Initializing the project as a git repository
* Running the stubbed unit tests (which will fail -- intentionally!)


### 2.1 TDD with LFE

``lfetool`` encourages you to engage in TDD by including a broken test in the stubbed unit tests for the project. So, first things first, let's get that failing unit test passing.

Be sure you are in your project directory:

```bash
$ cd my-test-lib
```

Here's the output we saw when the unit test failed:

```erlang
======================== EUnit ========================
unit-my-test-lib-tests: my-adder-test ...[failed]
in function 'unit-my-test-lib-tests':'my-adder-test'/0
**error:{assertEqual-failed,[{module,'unit-my-test-lib-tests'},
          {line,11},
          {expression,"(: my-test-lib my-adder 2 2)"},
          {expected,4},
          {value,5}]}
=======================================================
  Failed: 1.  Skipped: 0.  Passed: 0.
```

We can see that our test expected 4 but it got 5.


Let's look at the test by opening up ``test/my-test-lib_tests.lfe``. Well, things there look good -- we should get 4 when 2 and 2 are added.

Let's take a look at the source module: ``src/my-test-lib.lfe``. Ah-ha! a
bug :-) There's an extra operation that's being done which we don't want.

To fix it, change this line:

```lisp
  (+ x (+ y 1)))
```

to this:

```lisp
  (+ x y))
```

Now re-run the unit tests:

```bash
$ make check-unit
```

And you should get a passing test:

```
==> my-test-lib (eunit)
======================== EUnit ========================
unit-my-test-lib-tests: my-adder-test ...[0.002 s] [ok]
=======================================================
  Test passed.
```

The ``make`` target we executed above executes the unit test runner without recompiling all the dependencies; it just re-compiles our project ``./src`` and ``./test`` files.

We'll talk about the ``make`` targets at the end of the Quick Start.


### 2.2 Project Inventory

Okay, we've got our tests passing and our project looks healthy. But what does
it have in it?

* a README file in Markdown
* a ``Makefile``
* the ``rebar.config`` file we mentioned earlier (this has all your project
  dependencies in it)
* a ``package.exs`` file for uploading your project to
  <a href="http://expm.co">expm.co</a>
* the ``src`` directory which holds your project code, and
* the ``test`` directory which holds the tests

There are some other things there (e.g., the ``deps`` directory created by ``rebar``
and the ``ebin`` directory that's created when everything is compiled).


### 2.3 Repo Ready to Go

As mentioned above, ``lfetool`` also ``init``'ed the project with ``git``
and added all the files:

```bash
$ git status
# On branch master
#
# Initial commit
#
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
#
#	new file:   .gitignore
#	new file:   .travis.yml
#	new file:   Makefile
#	new file:   README.md
#	new file:   package.exs
#	new file:   rebar.config
#	new file:   resources/make/common.mk
#	new file:   src/my-test-lib-util.lfe
#	new file:   src/my-test-lib.app.src
#	new file:   src/my-test-lib.lfe
#	new file:   test/unit-my-test-lib-tests.lfe
#
```
Once your remote origin is configured for the repo, you can execute ``git commit -a && git push --all`` and have your initial files available on the remote server.

You can taste it, can't you? That LFE flavor coming your way? Yup, you're right.
